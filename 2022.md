Thoughts: This blog post is from 2002, 20 years later it's still useful. Abstration is a double-edged sword, it accelerates speed when it works but can be hard to debug when you don't understand the underlying complexity on which it's based(leakage). The takeaway is use abstraction when working but not learning.
